# Bringing phantomjs to the web
A simple browser based repl for nodejs, it has not been built for scaliblity. It could easily be extended but its just a proof of concept at this phase. There is still a ways to go before this word be usable, but it could be a good platform for some interesting testing tools.

  ```Shell
  npm install phantomjs -g
  git clone https://github.com/justengland/the-flying-dutchman.git
```
