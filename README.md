# Bringing phantomjs to the web
A simple browser based repl for nodejs, it has not been built for scaliblity. It could easily be extended but its just a proof of concept at this phase. There is still a ways to go before this word be usable, but it could be a good platform for some interesting testing tools.

  ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/justengland/the-flying-dutchman.git
    npm install phantomjs -g
    npm install
    npm start
```

The just launch your browser to and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
